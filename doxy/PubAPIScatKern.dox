/**
\defgroup scatteringkernels Scattering kernels & distributions
\brief This section contains the public API methods available for plotting the scattering kernels and electro distribution.

In this respect, these functions are not as 'public' as the single-pointing or cluster models.
Nevertheless, for visualisation and development it is beneficial to have direct access to these methods, hence this public API page.
